#Palindrome Detection

This is just a small experiment with python. It detects wether an input is a palindrome or not.

These examples are detected as palindrome:

+ madam
+ Glenelg
+ Rise to vote, Sir

This uses [PyVows](http://heynemann.github.io/pyvows/) to run unit test. Please install it first:

> $ pip install pyvows
